# Convent

Convent is a hacker house, incubator, and creative activity hub housed in a converted 22 bedroom convent building in Philadelphia, PA. 

"Our central mission is to transform the space into a sanctuary that positively affects culture away from the mind-numbing boredom of the current digital-first community standard."
